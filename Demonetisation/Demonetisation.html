   <h1>DEMONETISATION</h1>
  </div>
</main>
    <p>Demonetisation refers to the withdrawal or banning of the currency of denomination by the government. It means retirement or withdrawal of a note or coin in place of which a new form of currency is issued by the government. Demonetisation is done in a country once in few years to target issues like illegal practices corruption reduce tax avoidal and more digitalised money transfer.
        Demonetisation is a powerful weapon to reduce corruption and illegal practices. It lets people dealing with black money to come into the mainstream. Transactions for payments occurring in black are hindered due to withdrawal of currency. It encourages the citizens to make E-transactions which are much safe. Handling E-cash is much easier and secure then handling cash.</p>

<p>Another notable advantage is enormous use of bank services. Once this move is taken, people go cashless and require either the exchange of currency or use of credit. This leads to a considerable increase in bank income. This leaves minimal chance of tax avoidal. Due to all transactions being recorded and an account of all assets, everyone is forced to pay taxes. Thereby providing government with funds which are further used for welfare of citizens.
    Use of fake currency is a challenge for a country's economy. Demonetisation hinders its use by banning that particular currency form.</p>
    <p>Although there are many advantages of this revolutionary move, the challenges faced cannot be ignored. Demonetisation leads to chaos among people. One has to stand in queue for hours outside banks for exchange of currency. At times, people get exhausted and this leads to arguments and fights between bank employees and people or among people themselves. Going cashless is another challenge faced. Every transaction cannot be made digitally. Cash is required for many day to day activities. Also due to high demand of new currency, banks go cashless at times causing distress among people. Demonetisation create a major problem for rural people. They are generally  not aware of the uses of E-cash. Moreover, unavailability of internet service ads on to it. Thus, going cashless hinders many of their day-to-day works and in some cases the situation is worsen to such an extent that they commit suicide which is not at all intended.</p>
    <p>Although demonetisation is a revolutionary, move its efficiency depends on the people in power to a great extent. It is unfair for the politicians to make wrong use of there power. Members of the ruling party are aware about it much before its execution and therefore they are completely prepared for it. They use tactics to convert their black money two white which saves them from huge losses at the time of demonetisation. This is way to unfair on their part.</p>
<p>Thus, efficiency of this revolutionary move depends on the loyalty of executors but its advantages in a long run cannot be neglected. It has been taken by governments all over the world at intervals to boost up their economy. Challenges faced are many but net outcome isn’t negative.
