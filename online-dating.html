   <h1>DATING: THEN AND NOW</h1>
  </div>
</main>
<br><p>With advancement in technology, relationships have revolutionalized to online level. About 10 years ago people used to meet through common friends and family but 10 years hence there has been a gigantic shift of dating culture to online dating. Almost everything is just a click (swipe XD) away. We can order food, groceries, clothes, shoes, furniture, books and more, online. All this has made our lives much simpler and more comfortable. Therefore, it only seems to be easier to find a partner on the internet than in person. There are several dating applications like tinder, bumble, meet me, woo etc. that are now available with the aim to help people find love.

<p>Joining dating apps is easy, one just needs to download the application and upload a few photos. You write about yourself, your interests and give your location. After mentioning a few details, you start getting suggestions of people to connect with. If you like someone you right swipe them and if you don�t then you left swipe them and this goes on. After connecting, people send each other messages and that�s how it all starts. You are likely to find anyone and everyone in your local area on dating apps.
</p>


<p>
In this fast-moving world people have jam-packed schedules and find it difficult to go out and meet someone the old fashion way. Dating apps help us to connect to people around as internet is not hampered by geographical or physical boundaries. At times approaching someone face to face becomes difficult and awkward; such apps are perfect for introverts. We get many options and chances to choose someone for ourselves. And if not connect romantically, one definitely makes new friends. Youngsters these days aren�t necessarily looking for something serious; their motive for joining dating apps is to find something casual. We often find interesting people on dating apps and go out on dates with people living nearby. There have been instances when people have found their perfect matches on such apps and gotten married.
</p>

<p>
Online dating has its fair share of drawbacks for example; there are several cases of fake accounts on such apps. The information that is provided may or may not be true. You might connect with people who do not have an attractive personality in reality. At times people find the ones they are not compatible with in real life. People often have different reasons for being on the dating app which makes it hard to find likeminded people. Dating apps are new era�s racism, people are judged by their looks and the kind of picture they upload. The first thing that we notice in a person on a dating app is his/hers face and body. We judge their beauty based on how they look or how photogenic they are rather than based on their personality and values.
</p>
<p>
To make online dating experience better one should verify their account and also connect with only the ones who have their accounts verified. Talking for a while on text before meeting someone or exchanging numbers with them is a safer option. While going out with the person you met online for the first time, you should inform and share location with your friends and family. It is smart to do a background check before getting serious about anything. One shouldn�t share too much information that can be misused in the future. Being real and honest about your intentions and reasons for being on the dating app is necessary.
</p>
<p>
Dating apps are there to help us find people to connect with but such apps shouldn�t be taken too seriously, the best way to date a person is to meet them in reality and know them for who they are without online filters.
